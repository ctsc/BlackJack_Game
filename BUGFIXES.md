# Bug Fixes - BlackJack Dealer Experience

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Card Numbers Not Displaying (Only Symbols)

**Problem:** Card values were not visible, only suit symbols showed.

**Root Cause:** The `.card-value` class had `color: inherit` which was inheriting from the wrong parent, likely transparent or the same as background.

**Solution:**
```css
.card-value {
    font-size: 2rem;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #000;  /* Changed from: color: inherit; */
}

.card-suit {
    font-size: 2.5rem;
    color: #000;  /* Added explicit color */
}

/* Added color matching for red suits */
.card-front:has(.card-suit.heart) .card-value,
.card-front:has(.card-suit.diamond) .card-value {
    color: #dc143c;
}
```

**Result:** 
- Card numbers now display in black for spades/clubs
- Card numbers display in red (#dc143c) for hearts/diamonds
- All card values are clearly visible

### 2. ‚úÖ Dealer Shoe Cards Showing as Green Box

**Problem:** The dealer shoe card stack appeared as a raised green box instead of displaying actual card backs.

**Root Cause:** 
- Deck cards didn't have explicit width/height set
- `.card-back` elements inside deck cards weren't being displayed properly
- Missing display and sizing properties

**Solution:**
```css
.deck-card {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    pointer-events: none;
    width: 80px;          /* Added */
    height: 112px;        /* Added */
}

.deck-card .card-back {
    width: 100%;          /* Added */
    height: 100%;         /* Added */
    display: block;       /* Added */
}

.burn-card {
    /* ... existing styles ... */
    width: 80px;          /* Added */
    height: 112px;        /* Added */
}

.burn-card .card-back {
    width: 100%;          /* Added */
    height: 100%;         /* Added */
    display: block;       /* Added */
}

.card-back {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--card-back) 0%, var(--card-back-pattern) 100%);
    transform: rotateY(180deg);
    border-radius: 8px;
    position: relative;   /* Added for proper positioning */
}
```

**Result:**
- Dealer shoe now displays proper card backs with blue gradient
- Stack of 8 cards visible with proper depth
- Burn card displays correctly
- Shuffle animation works on visible cards

### 3. ‚úÖ Green & Blue Chips Hover Effect Not Working

**Problem:** Green and blue chips in the chip bank were not responding to hover (scale up and glow).

**Root Cause:** The hover transform was being overridden or not prioritized correctly due to CSS specificity issues.

**Solution:**
```css
.chip.hoverable:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2) translateY(-5px) !important;  /* Added !important */
    box-shadow: 
        0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6),
        0 0 20px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.6),
        0 0 40px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.4) !important;     /* Added !important */
}
```

**Result:**
- All 5 chips (white, red, green, blue, black) now have working hover effects
- Chips scale to 1.2x size
- Chips lift 5px when hovered
- Golden glow effect appears on all chips
- Smooth transitions maintained

1. **Open `blackjack.html` in browser**
2. **Check card values:**
   - Look at player cards - you should see "J ‚ô•", "10 ‚ô¶", etc.
   - Look at dealer cards - you should see "A ‚ô†", "K ‚ô†"
3. **Check dealer shoe:**
   - Look at upper right area near dealer
   - You should see a blue card back (not green box)
   - Multiple cards stacked with shuffle animation
4. **Check chip hover:**
   - Hover over each chip in the chip bank
   - **Green chip should glow and scale up**
   - **Blue chip should glow and scale up**
   - All 5 chips should respond
