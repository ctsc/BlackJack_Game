# BlackJack Dealer Experience - Changelog

## Latest Update: Realistic Blackjack Dealing Sequence

### 🎴 Major Improvements

#### 1. **Authentic Blackjack Dealing Order**
- **Burn Card First** (0.5s - 2.5s): Card slides off the top of the shoe before dealing begins
- **Round 1 - Face Up Cards** (2.8s - 4.0s):
  - Player 1 → Player 2 → Player 3 → Dealer
  - All cards dealt face up
- **Round 2 - Second Cards** (4.4s - 5.6s):
  - Player 1 → Player 2 → Player 3 → Dealer
  - Players receive face-up cards
  - Dealer receives face-down "hole card"

#### 2. **Enhanced Dealer Shoe**
- Repositioned to upper-right area near the dealer
- More prominent with labeled "Dealer Shoe" text
- 8 stacked cards for realistic depth
- Visible source point for all dealt cards
- Cards visually slide from shoe to positions

#### 3. **Interactive Dealer Hole Card**
- Dealer's second card dealt face down (traditional blackjack)
- **Hover to flip and reveal**: Smooth 3D card flip animation
- Realistic card flipping with rotateY transformation
- Easy to identify with cursor change

#### 4. **Improved Card Animations**
- Cards now clearly originate from the dealer shoe
- Smooth arcing motion from shoe to table positions
- Realistic rotation during flight (90° to 0°)
- Cards scale from small to full size during deal
- Better timing: 1 second per card deal

### 🎯 Technical Enhancements

}

@keyframes burnCardSlide {
    0% → 100%: translate + rotate + fade out
}

/* Realistic dealing paths */
Each card: 
  - Starts at deck position (translate 200-400px, -200px)
  - Arcs through midpoint (rotateZ 90° → 45°)

```
