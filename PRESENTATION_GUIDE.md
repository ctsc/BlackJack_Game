## 📊 Slide 1: Title & Introduction (1 minute)

### What to Say:
> "Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today we're presenting our BlackJack Dealer Experience - a pure HTML and CSS web application that simulates an authentic casino card table.
>
> Our team consists of myself, Carter Tierney, who handled the coding and development, and Adnan, who managed testing and quality assurance.
>
> This project challenged us to create a fully interactive, animated experience without using any JavaScript - relying entirely on CSS transforms, transitions, and keyframe animations."

**Show:** Introduction page on screen

---

## 📊 Slide 2: Problem Statement (2 minutes)

### What to Say:
> "The challenge we addressed was: How can we create engaging, interactive web experiences using only HTML and CSS?
>
> Modern web development often relies heavily on JavaScript for animations and interactivity. However, CSS has evolved to become incredibly powerful. We wanted to demonstrate that with creative use of CSS animations, transforms, and transitions, we can create experiences that feel dynamic and responsive.
>
> This is particularly relevant for:
> - Performance optimization (CSS animations are GPU-accelerated)
> - Progressive enhancement (works even if JavaScript fails)
> - Accessibility (respects user motion preferences)
> - Learning fundamentals before adding JavaScript complexity"

**Show:** Project description section on intro page

---

## 📊 Slide 3: Project Goals & Requirements (1 minute)

### What to Say:
> "Our project had several core requirements and stretch goals.
>
> Core features included:
> - Shuffle animation for the card deck
> - Sequential card dealing with realistic movement
> - Interactive chip hover effects with glow
> - Theme customization using CSS variables
>
> For extra credit, we implemented all three stretch goals:
> - 3D perspective with realistic card angles
> - Dealer burn card animation
> - Hover peek effect on player cards
>
> We also ensured responsive design and accessibility features throughout."

---

## 🎮 Slide 4: Live Demo (4-5 minutes)

### What to Say & Do:

**Click "Enter Casino" button**

> "Let me walk you through the experience..."

**Point out the dealing sequence:**
> "When the page loads, you'll see cards automatically deal from the dealer shoe on the left. Notice how each card follows its own path with rotation and delay - first to the dealer, then to each of the three player positions."

**Wait for animation to complete, then demonstrate hover effects:**

> "The player cards have a 'peek' feature. Watch what happens when I hover over them..."

**Hover over player cards one by one**

> "See how they lift and tilt? This uses multiple CSS transforms - translateY, rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ - to create a 3D effect."

**Scroll to chip bank:**

> "The chips also have interactive effects. When you hover over them in the chip bank..."

**Hover over different colored chips**

> "They scale up and emit a golden glow using animated box-shadow. Each chip color is defined using CSS variables."

**Click through theme options in top-right:**

> "We implemented theme customization. Watch as I switch between Classic Green, Royal Blue, and Ruby Red table themes. All of this happens instantly through CSS variable changes - no page reload needed."

**Point out the deck area:**

> "Notice the dealer shoe on the left - it has a continuous shuffle animation, and you can see the burn card sliding off the top. This is a traditional casino practice before dealing."

**Switch to mobile view (if possible) or resize browser:**

> "The design is fully responsive. On smaller screens, the layout adapts - the deck and chip bank reposition, cards scale down, and navigation becomes vertical."

---

## 💻 Slide 5: Code Highlights - CSS Variables (2 minutes)

### What to Say:

**Open `styles.css` in editor, show CSS variables section (lines 1-20)**

> "Let me show you some key technical implementations.
>
> First, our theme system uses CSS custom properties - also called CSS variables. At the root level, we define all our color values:"

**Point to code:**
```css
:root {
    --felt-color: #0d5e2a;
    --chip-red: #dc143c;
    --table-border: #8b6914;
}
```

> "When a user selects a different theme, we simply override these variables. For example, the blue theme changes the felt to a deep blue. This cascades through the entire application instantly.
>
> This approach is much more maintainable than hard-coding colors everywhere. Want to change the red chip color? Update one variable."

---

## 💻 Slide 6: Code Highlights - 3D Transforms (2 minutes)

### What to Say:

**Show card 3D perspective code (around lines 366-382)**

> "One of our stretch goals was implementing 3D perspective. This required understanding how CSS handles 3D space.
>
> First, we set a perspective on the table container:"

```css
.table-container {
    perspective: 1000px;
}
```

> "This creates a viewing distance - imagine you're sitting 1000 pixels away from the table.
>
> Then for each card, we use transform-style: preserve-3d and apply rotations:"

```css
.card {
    transform-style: preserve-3d;
    transform: rotateY(-5deg) rotateX(2deg);
}
```

> "This creates that slight angle you saw on the cards. When combined with the hover peek effect, it creates a realistic 3D appearance."

---

## 💻 Slide 7: Code Highlights - Animation Sequences (2 minutes)

### What to Say:

**Show deal animation keyframes (around lines 448-510)**

> "The card dealing sequence was one of the most complex parts. Each card needed to:
> 1. Start at the deck position
> 2. Travel to its final destination
> 3. Flip from face-down to face-up
> 4. Arrive at slightly different times
>
> We achieved this with keyframe animations and staggered delays:"

**Show example:**
```css
.player1-card-1 {
    animation: dealToPlayer1Card1 1.5s ease-out 0.6s both;
}

@keyframes dealToPlayer1Card1 {
    0% {
        transform: translate(-500px, -100px) rotateY(180deg);
        opacity: 0;
    }
    100% {
        transform: translate(0, 0) rotateY(0deg);
        opacity: 1;
    }
}
```

> "The animation takes 1.5 seconds, starts after a 0.6 second delay, and transforms the card from the deck position to the player's spot while flipping it over. Each subsequent card has a longer delay, creating the sequential dealing effect."

---

## 💻 Slide 8: Code Highlights - Hover Effects (1 minute)

### What to Say:

**Show chip hover code (around lines 541-549)**

> "The chip hover effect demonstrates transition timing and multiple box-shadows:"

```css
.chip.hoverable:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2) translateY(-5px);
    box-shadow: 
        0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6),
        0 0 20px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.6),
        0 0 40px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.4);
}
```

> "We layer three shadows: one for depth, two for the glow effect with different blur radii. Combined with the scale and lift transform, it creates a responsive, tactile feeling."

---

## 📊 Slide 9: Responsive Design & Accessibility (1 minute)

### What to Say:

**Show media queries (around lines 707-770)**

> "We implemented responsive design with three main breakpoints:
> - 1200px: Tablet landscape
> - 768px: Tablet portrait and large phones
> - 480px: Small phones
>
> At each breakpoint, we adjust card sizes, reposition elements, and simplify layouts.
>
> For accessibility, we included a reduced-motion media query:"

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    * {
        animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    }
}
```

> "If a user has indicated they prefer reduced motion in their system settings, all our animations essentially become instant. This respects users with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity."

---

## 📊 Slide 10: Testing & Kanban Methodology (1 minute)

### What to Say:

> "Adnan led our testing efforts, verifying functionality across:
> - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
> - Desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
> - Different screen resolutions and orientations
>
> We used Kanban methodology to manage our workflow. This provided:
> - Clear visual organization of tasks
> - Flexibility to adapt as challenges arose
> - Continuous progress tracking
> - Better team communication
>
> Our board had four columns: To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done. We held brief daily check-ins to update progress and identify blockers."

**Show README section on testing if time permits**

---

## 📊 Slide 11: Challenges & Solutions (1-2 minutes)

### What to Say:

> "We faced several interesting challenges:
>
> **Challenge 1: Animation Timing**
> The initial card dealing felt too fast and mechanical. We experimented with different delays and durations, settling on 0.3-second intervals which felt natural and allowed viewers to follow each card.
>
> **Challenge 2: Mobile Layout**
> The absolute positioning that worked great on desktop caused overlap issues on mobile. We solved this by switching to static positioning for the deck and chip bank on smaller screens.
>
> **Challenge 3: 3D Perspective Balance**
> Too much rotation made cards hard to read; too little looked flat. We fine-tuned the angles to 5 degrees on Y-axis and 2 degrees on X-axis for optimal visibility while maintaining 3D feel.
>
> **Challenge 4: Performance**
> Multiple simultaneous animations could cause jank. We used GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) instead of layout-triggering properties (width, height, top, left) to ensure smooth 60fps animations."

---

## 📊 Slide 12: What We Learned (1 minute)

### What to Say:

> "This project significantly expanded our CSS skills. Key learnings included:
>
> 1. **CSS is more powerful than we realized** - We created complex interactions without JavaScript
> 2. **Animation timing is crucial** - Small delay adjustments made huge UX differences
> 3. **3D transforms open new possibilities** - Understanding perspective and rotation planes
> 4. **Variables enable maintainability** - The theme system would be nightmare without CSS custom properties
> 5. **Accessibility matters** - Reduced motion support ensures inclusive experiences
> 6. **Testing is essential** - Cross-browser and device testing caught many issues
>
> We also gained experience with team collaboration and Kanban project management."

---

## 📊 Slide 13: Future Enhancements (1 minute)

### What to Say:

> "If we were to expand this project, we'd consider:
>
> - **Adding JavaScript** for actual game logic - hit, stand, betting mechanics
> - **Sound effects** - card shuffling, chip clicks, dealer callouts
> - **More games** - Poker, Baccarat, Roulette
> - **Multiplayer capability** - Real-time games with other players
> - **Persistent preferences** - Save theme choices and settings
> - **Tutorial mode** - Teach new players how to play
> - **Advanced animations** - Card splitting, doubling down animations
>
> However, the pure CSS foundation we've built provides an excellent base for any of these enhancements."

---

## 📊 Slide 14: Conclusion (1 minute)

### What to Say:

> "To summarize:
>
> We successfully created an engaging, interactive blackjack dealer experience using only HTML and CSS. We implemented all four core features plus all three stretch goals for extra credit.

## 🎯 Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions & Answers:

**Q: Why not use JavaScript?**
> A: The project requirement was CSS-only, but this also demonstrates CSS capabilities and creates a foundation for progressive enhancement. CSS animations are GPU-accelerated and more performant in many cases.

**Q: How did you calculate the animation paths?**
> A: We used trial and error with browser DevTools, adjusting transform values until the paths looked natural. We started with approximate positions and refined them iteratively.

**Q: What was the hardest part?**
> A: Coordinating the timing of all eight cards dealing in sequence. Getting the delays and durations right so it felt smooth but not rushed took significant iteration.

**Q: Does this work in older browsers?**
> A: Modern CSS features require recent browser versions (last 2-3 years). For older browsers, we'd need fallbacks or prefixes. But our target audience uses current browsers.

**Q: How long did this take?**
> A: Approximately 20-25 hours total: 5 hours planning, 12 hours coding, 4 hours testing, 4 hours documentation and polish.

**Q: Could you add real gameplay?**
> A: Yes! JavaScript could track game state, card values, betting, etc. Our HTML/CSS provides the visual interface that JavaScript could control.

**Q: How do you switch themes without JavaScript?**
> A: Currently users click theme options which are anchor links. For a real theme switcher without page reload, we'd need JavaScript. However, the CSS variable structure makes it easy to implement when ready.

**Q: What about accessibility beyond reduced motion?**
> A: We used semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy, sufficient color contrast, and keyboard-accessible links. For a production app, we'd add ARIA labels and keyboard controls for interactive elements.
