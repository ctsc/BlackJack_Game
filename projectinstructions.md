Project Ideas: Design and Implementations Using CSS (Transforms, Transitions, Animation) Only
(Be Creative) - you have to option to add your own – must include in the proposal)
The Objective:
Develop a visually engaging and interactive web interface that demonstrates mastery of CSS
transforms, transitions, and keyframe animations without using JavaScript. This project challenges you
to combine layout design, motion principles, and responsive styling to create an experience that is
both functional and aesthetically appealing. You will select one theme-based concept and bring it to life
through pure CSS animations, focusing on user interaction, storytelling, and accessibility.
Your goal is to:
• Plan and design a creative interface using wireframes and motion storyboards.
• Implement responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
• Apply motion thoughtfully to enhance usability and engagement, not just decoration.
• Demonstrate originality by customizing themes, colors, and animation timing.
• Document your process through annotated CSS and reflection on design decisions.
About the Projects: Motion-First UI with Pure CSS (Transforms, Transitions, Animations)
What you will do : Build an interactive, visually engaging interface using only HTML + CSS (no
JavaScript). Apply CSS transforms, transitions, and keyframe animations to create meaningful motion.
What Are Stretch Goals?
Stretch Goals are optional, advanced features that go beyond the basic requirements (Core Features).
They are designed to:
• Challenge you to explore more advanced CSS techniques.
• Add extra polish and creativity to your project.
• Help you stand out by demonstrating deeper understanding.
Important:
• You must complete all Core Features first before attempting Stretch Goals.
• Stretch Goals are not required for passing, but they can earn bonus points and improve your
grade.
• They should enhance the user experience, not just add complexity.

Milestone Schedule

STEP ONE

: Static Layout Build
• Create HTML + CSS layout only (no animations yet).

STEP TWO  Motion Integration
• Add CSS transitions and keyframes for interactions and sequences.

step three Final Polish & Accessibility
• Add reduced-motion alternative using @media (prefers-reduced-motion).
• Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop.

• Submit reflection document: explain how animations improve UX (not just decoration).
Project Topics (Choose ONE)


Each topic includes Core Features (must-have) and Stretch Goals (you must implement 2) Should you
do all you will get extra credit).




1) Card Table “Dealer Demo” – Black Jack or Baccarat - ONLY
Core Features:
• Shuffle Animation: Animate cards fanning out and stacking using @keyframes.
• Deal Sequence: Cards slide to player positions using transform: translate() with animation-
delay.
• Chip Hover Effect: Chips scale up slightly and glow using box-shadow on hover.
• Theme Customization: Use CSS variables for felt color, chip colors, and table border.
Stretch Goals:
• 3D Perspective: Apply transform: perspective() and rotateY() for realistic card angles.
• Dealer Burn Card: Animate a card sliding off the deck before dealing.
• Hover Peek: Slightly lift a player’s card on hover using translateY and rotate.

furnish a GitHub repository link directing to the current work submission for assessment. Merely
submitting the file will not suffice for evaluation. You should not just upload the files to Git Hub but
use Git Hub for continuous development and we will check the commit history.



Grading Criteria
Please see the Presentation grade sheet link to be clear on what you will be graded on.
Your grade will be determined by the following criteria:

If you fulfill the specified requirements (please refer to the Requirements section above), you will be
awarded full credit. To receive credit, your team must adhere to the designated submission guidelines
for both the paper and presentations. Merely submitting the files to iCollege will not be considered
adequate. It is imperative that you also upload the project to the CODD server, and all team members
must ensure their projects are posted on Dropbox. Additionally, it is advisable for all members to share
the Dropbox links to ensure accurate grading and reporting of your grades.
